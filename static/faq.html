<h2>What is the course pattern?</h2>

<p>
In the 1st and 2nd year, everyone studies all the subjects. In the 3rd
year, students have to choose their subject of specialization called
<b>majors</b>. You can choose from physics, chemistry, maths, biology
or earth science. Also you get to choose a few courses as your minors.
</p>

<h2>What are the future prospects/placements?</h2>

<p>
Since no batch of IISER has passed out yet, we can not tell for sure
what or how much the placements would be. Taking into account the
importance the government is giving to IISERs, you can be assured of a great
future.
</p>

<p>
The MS programme offered at IISER is similar to an integrated MSc
degree, but is more research oriented. Hence the prospects after doing
an MS degree will be research based jobs. These research jobs can be
at any government institution like <a
href="http://www.csir.res.in">CSIR</a>, <a
href="http://www.tifr.res.in">TIFR</a>, <a
href="http://www.isro.org">ISRO</a>, etc. or in any private company
which does research. Many private companies have their own R&amp;D
divisions.
</p>

<p>
Interested students are encouraged to remain in academics and complete
their Ph.D. rather than going for a job right after the completion of MS
degree.
</p>

<h2>Do only extended list students join IISER?</h2>
<p>
No, merit listed candidates are preferred over extended list
candidates in the IISERs. There are quite a few merit listed students
studying at IISER at present. Moreover many <a
href="http://www.iisc.ernet.in/kvpy">KVPY</a> fellows join IISER as
well.
